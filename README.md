## 1 About this package:
This package describes the workflow to utilize GWAS data from MSSNG to build polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the prediction of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk. In this project, we also selected the best way to build PRS. Previous studies have limited ability to support sufficient risk prediction for polygenic inheritance of ASD because of the small size of GWASes and paucity of computational methods. Since Schizophrenia and education attainment are highly corelated with ASD as previously described, we can derive PRS by using GWAS of Schizophrenia and education attainment.
